README - websocket-client

This is a quick and dirty websocket *client* written in very plain Java. It's not elegant
and only supports the hybi-00 [1] draft of the protocol (the one currently implemented in
Chrome and current spoken by *most servers (or at least the ones I plan to use it with).

This library has 0 dependent jars (not counting junit, used only for unit tests).
